      I am a software engineer specialized in backend technologies. Recently, I've been developing a
      growing interest in low-level computing concepts. I have experience working with various
      languages and technologies such as Golang, Rust, Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), Vue, React,
      Docker, and Google Cloud. I continuously seek to enhance my expertise in the field and remain
      dedicated to delivering high-quality results.
